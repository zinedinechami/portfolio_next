    "blog_post": "I built and designed the front-end of an appartement rental website inspired by Airbnb, showcasing my skills in  implementing front-end design and development. I designed an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface where dynamic information retrieval for listings occurs in real-time on both the homepage and individual property pages. To enhance user experience, I incorporated a search feature, allowing users to quickly and easily find their ideal rental. Additionally, by leveraging React Router, I developed a single-page application (SPA), ensuring smooth and fast navigation between different sections of the site."

Next.js was instrumental in providing a robust framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, which significantly improved the page's performance and SEO capabilities. Tailwind CSS was utilized to craft a visually appealing and highly customizable design. These technologies facilitated the creation of a sleek, functional, and user-friendly landing page that effectively showcases the renovation services offered by Renov a 9."
